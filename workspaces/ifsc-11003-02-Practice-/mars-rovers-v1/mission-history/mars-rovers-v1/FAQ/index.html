  <h3>Answers About NASA’s Mars Rovers</h3>
  <p>Here are some commonly asked questions about Mars rovers and their missions.</p>
</section>

<section class="container" id="practice">

  <h2>General Questions</h2>

  <p><strong>What is a Mars rover?</strong><br>
  A Mars rover is a robotic vehicle designed to travel across the surface of Mars and study the planet’s environment, rocks, and atmosphere.</p>

  <p><strong>Why does NASA send rovers to Mars?</strong><br>
  Rovers help scientists search for signs of ancient life, learn about Mars’ climate history, and prepare for future human missions.</p>

  <p><strong>How do rovers send data back to Earth?</strong><br>
  Rovers transmit signals to Mars orbiters, which then relay information back to Earth using radio waves.</p>

  <p><strong>How long do rovers last?</strong><br>
  Many rovers are designed to work for a few years, but some last much longer. Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years!</p>

  <h2>About the Rovers</h2>

  <p><strong>What was the purpose of Spirit and Opportunity?</strong><br>
  These twin rovers were built to search for signs of water on Mars and study rocks to understand the planet’s past.</p>

  <p><strong>What makes Curiosity different?</strong><br>
  Curiosity is larger, nuclear-powered, and carries an advanced laboratory to analyze chemical samples.</p>

  <p><strong>Can rovers take selfies?</strong><br>
  Yes! Rovers use special cameras to take photos of themselves, mostly to inspect equipment and wheels.</p>

  <p><strong>Do rovers move on their own?</strong><br>
  Rovers can drive short distances autonomously, but engineers on Earth plan most of their movement.</p>

  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

  <p><strong>How fast do rovers drive?</strong><br>
  Very slowly — about the speed of a turtle (around 0.1 mph).</p>

  <p><strong>What is the largest rover?</strong><br>
  Curiosity is one of the largest rovers ever sent to Mars.</p>

  <p><strong>Can rovers get stuck?</strong><br>
  Yes — Spirit got trapped in soft soil in 2009 and could not escape.</p>
