    <h3>Robotic Explorers on the Red Planet</h3>
    <p>For more than two decades, NASA’s Mars Rover Program has sent robotic explorers to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life, 
      study Martian climate, and prepare for future human missions. These rovers operate as mobile science labs, traveling across Mars' cold 
      and dusty surface to take photographs, analyze rocks, and transmit valuable data back to Earth.</p>
    <p>Mars is a harsh and mysterious world, but rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity have helped scientists unlock its secrets.
         From discovering evidence of ancient water to measuring radiation levels for astronaut safety, these robotic explorers continue to 
         change what we know about our neighboring planet.</p>
    <p>This website highlights three of NASA’s most important Mars rovers and showcases their missions, discoveries, and advanced technology.</p>

      </header>
      <p>Curiosity is a nuclear-powered rover exploring Gale Crater to determine whether Mars ever had conditions suitable for life. It studies the planet’s
climate, rock layers, and chemistry to better understand Mars’ past.

      </header>
      <p>Spirit and Opportunity were twin rovers designed to search for evidence that water once flowed on the Martian surface. Together, they transformed what we know about Mars’ history.</p>

    <h2>Why Mars?</h2>
    <p>Mars is one of Earth’s closest neighbors and the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Scientists study Mars to:
      Search for signs of ancient life
      Learn how planets evolve
      Study weather and climate patterns
      Prepare for human missions to deep space
      Each rover mission brings us closer to understanding whether life ever existed on Mars and whether humans could one day explore it safely.</p>
    <h2>Featured Mars Rovers</h2>
      <p>This website highlights three of NASA’s most successful Mars missions:
Spirit – Explored Martian rocks and soil, finding evidence of ancient water
Opportunity – Traveled farther on Mars than any other rover, discovering mineral clues about Mars’ wetter past
Curiosity – Continues to explore crater terrain and search for chemical signs of life today
Visit each rover’s feature page to learn more about its mission, discoveries, and technology.</p>
<p>NASA’s rovers are more than machines — they are explorers sending humanity’s curiosity across millions of miles. Every image and data point helps 
  scientists rewrite what we know about our solar system and prepares astronauts for journeys beyond Earth.</p>
