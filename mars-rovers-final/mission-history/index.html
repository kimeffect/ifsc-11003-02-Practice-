  <h1>Mission History</h1>
  <h2>Timeline of NASA’s Mars Rover Program</h2>

  <p>
    NASA’s Mars Rover Program has advanced scientific discovery by sending robotic
    explorers to study Mars’ surface, climate, and geology. Each mission builds on
    the one before, using improved technology to explore farther and operate longer
    than ever imagined.

      <h2>Spirit Lands at Gusev Crater</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Spirit was designed to analyze Martian rocks and terrain for evidence of ancient
      water. The rover far exceeded its 90-day mission, lasting more than six years.
      It discovered silica deposits that suggested Mars once had hot springs.

      <h2>Opportunity Begins Its Journey</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Opportunity landed in a region known to contain water-formed minerals.
      It discovered layered rocks and minerals that revealed Mars once had a wet
      environment capable of supporting life.

      <h2>Curiosity Arrives in Gale Crater</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Curiosity landed using the sky crane system and went on to discover ancient lakebeds,
      organic compounds, and radiation levels that help prepare humans for Mars missions.

      <h2>Legacy of the Rovers</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Together, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity provided clear evidence that Mars
      once had liquid water and conditions that may have supported life.
    </p>
    <p>
      These missions reshaped Mars science and set the foundation for future robotic
      and human exploration.
