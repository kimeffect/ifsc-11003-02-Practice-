<p>I collected feedback from a classmate, Jayden, on the initial version of the project. The primary goal was to identify issues in usability, clarity, and overall functionality. I received feedback concerning Issue 1: The main control buttons were visually inconsistent and looked confusing on smaller phone screens. Issue 2: The descriptive text for the Segway's features was dense and lacked clear headings. I also received feedback that the contrast on the navigation bar was low, especially in bright light.

I addressed the feedback in the following ways. To address the difficulty with Issue 1, I unified the button styles using a clear blue background and white text, and I implemented a media query to increase the tap target size and stack the buttons vertically on mobile screens. This modification was necessary to improve mobile usability and ensure consistency. Regarding Issue 2, I broke the feature descriptions into three distinct paragraphs, each headed by a descriptive tag. This change was important for improving content readability and scannability, directly benefiting users accessing the site quickly. I also increased the contrast on the navigation bar by darkening the background color, resolving the low contrast issue.</p>
<p>Working on the Segway project and throughout this semester has been a significant learning experience that has shifted my perspective on web development from a focus on features to a focus on the user. I feel I did well in separating my concerns by effectively using external CSS and JavaScript files. This kept my HTML clean and made the project much easier to maintain and debug, directly reflecting the separation of concerns principle we discussed. Furthermore, I was particularly successful at debugging the complex JavaScript calculation for the Segway's speed and battery life on my first try. I spent extra time planning the logic beforehand, which saved a lot of development time later.

If I had to start this project over, I would allocate more time to the initial semantic HTML structure. I found myself having to go back and rename several generic div s to more meaningful tags like header or main late in the development cycle, which required minor CSS adjustments. I would also make a habit of getting user feedback earlier in the development process. Waiting until the project was "finished" meant that fixing the issues was sometimes more disruptive than if I had checked in with a user after completing the basic HTML and CSS layers. This would be a more progressive enhancement approach to my workflow itself.</p>
