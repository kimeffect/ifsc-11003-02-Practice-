<p>In my own words, progressive enhancement is about building a website from the ground up, starting with a solid, accessible foundation of semantic HTML (the content). This ensures that the core information and functionality are available to every user, regardless of their browser, device, or network speed.The key difference from the older "graceful degradation" approach is the starting point. Graceful degradation starts with the full, advanced experience and then tries to patch it up for older browsers. Progressive enhancement starts with the simplest, most universal experience and then enhances it for more capable environments.</p>
